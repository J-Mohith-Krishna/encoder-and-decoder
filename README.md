# encoder-and-decoder
## Description-
The Python script provided herein showcases a sophisticated program designed with the capability to encode and decode any input sentence with finesse and precision.
## Explanation-
  1. We've begun by importing the necessary packages to empower our program with essential functionalities.

  2. Next, we've set the number of epochs and defined the directory for saving files as the initial steps.

  3. We've meticulously constructed the input token index, laying the foundation for further operations.

  4. Seamlessly integrating input_text and target_text, we've embarked on constructing the encoder segment, a pivotal component of our system.

  5. Leveraging the potency of the LSTM algorithm, we've intricately fused the encoder with the decoder, forging a robust connection essential for effective processing.

  6. With the core components in place, we've proceeded to build the model and compile it, incorporating essential metrics to ensure its efficiency and effectiveness.

  7. Skillfully crafting the decoder, we've augmented the functionality of our program, enhancing its capabilities for handling diverse input scenarios.

  8. Finally, as the culmination of our efforts, we proudly present the results, showcasing the prowess and sophistication of our encoded and decoded output.
